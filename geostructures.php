	<h2>Influence of geological structures on the development of coastal landscapes</h2>
	<ul>
        <li> Geological structures include jointing (fracture dividing rocks), dip (indentations), faulting (cracks in crust) and folding (overlapping of the earthâ€™s crust to create ridges).</li>
        <li>
            These processes are vital in determining coastal morphology and erosion rates. They also produce cliff profiles and micro features such as caves and arches.</li>
<li>Geological structures are responsible for the formation of:<br>
- Concordant Coastlines: where beds, layers and rocks are folded into ridges that run parallel to the coast. Usually, concordant coastlines have the same type of rock along its length. Dalmatian and Haff morphology occurs on these coastlines.Lulworth Cove is situated on the south coast of England, on a concordant coastline. The entrance to the cove is narrow where the waves have cut through weaknesses in the resistant limestone. Then the cove widens where the softer clays have been more easily eroded.<br>
    - Discordant Coastlines: bands of rock and layers run perpendicular to the coastline. Usually the geology alternates between strata of hard rock and soft rocks. Headlands and Bays occur at these coastlines as erosion resistance is different between rocks, so they wear away at different speeds. Part of the Dorset coastline running north from the Portland limestone of Durlston Head is a clear example of a discordant coastline. The Portland limestone is resistant to erosion; then to the north there is a bay at Swanage where the rock type is a softer greensand.</li>
