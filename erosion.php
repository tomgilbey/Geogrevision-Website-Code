	<h2>Marine erosion and coastal landforms/landscapes</h2>
	<ul>
        <li>Erosion is a collaborative process which involves the removal of sediment from a coastline by different types of erosion, not one type acting by itself. The main processes of erosion are:</li><br>
<li>● Corrasion - Sand and pebbles are picked up by the sea from an offshore sediment sink or temporal store and hurled against the cliffs at high tide, causing the cliffs to be eroded. The shape, size, weight and quantity of sediment picked up, as well as the wave speed, affects the erosive power of this process.</li><br>
<li>● Abrasion - This is the process where sediment is moved along the shoreline , causing it to be worn down over time . If a watermelon was being eroded (theoretically), corrasion would be throwing stones at it and abrasion would be rubbing the stones against the skin of the watermelon. Both will cause damage to the watermelon over time.</li><br>
<li>● Attrition - Wave action cause rocks and pebbles to hit against each other , wearing each other down and so becoming round and eventually smaller. Attrition is an erosive process within the coastal environment, but has little to no effect on erosion of the coastline itself.</li><br>
<li>● Hydraulic Action - As a wave crashes onto a rock or cliff face, air is forced into cracks, joints and faults within the rock. The high pressure causes the cracks to force apart and widen when the wave retreats and the air expands. Over time this causes the rock to fracture. Bubbles found within the water may implode under the high pressure creating tiny jets of water that over time erode the rock. This erosive process is cavitation.</li><br>
<li>● Corrosion (Solution) - The mildly acidic seawater can cause alkaline rock such as limestone to be eroded and is very similar to the process of carbonation weathering. This is a potential link between the carbon cycle, global warming and coasts. Will increases in rainwater and ocean acidity increase coastal erosion or will the effect by negligible? </li><br>
<li>● Wave Quarrying - This is when breaking waves that hit the cliff face exert a pressure up to 30 tonnes per m ². It is very similar to hydraulic action but acts with significantly more pressure to directly pull away rocks from a cliff face or remove smaller weathered fragments. The force of the breaking wave hammers the rocks surface , shaking and weakening it and leaving it open to attack from hydraulic action and abrasion.</li><br>
<li>Erosion rates are the highest when:</li><br>
<li>- waves are high and have a long fetch (the distance the wind has travelled over the wave)</li><br>
<li>- waves approach the coast perpendicular to the cliff.</li><br>
<li>- at high tide - waves travel higher up the cliff so a bigger area of cliff face is able to be eroded.</li><br>
<li>- heavy rainfall occurs - water percolates through permeable rock, weakening cliff.</li><br>
<li>- in winter - destructive waves are the largest and most destructive during winter.  </li><br>
        
<li>▪ Caves, Arches, Stacks & Stumps - This sequence occurs on pinnacle headlands. Marine erosion widens faults in the base of the headland, widening over time to create a cave. The cave will widen due to both marine erosion and sub-aerial processes, eroding through to the other side of the headland, creating an arch. The arch continue to widen until it is unable to support itself, falling under its own weight through mass movement, leaving a stack as one side of the arch becomes detached from the mainland. With marine erosion attacking the base of the stack, eventually the stack will collapse into a stump.<br>

<li>▪ Wave-cut notch and platform - Marine erosion attacks the base of a cliff, creating a notch of eroded material between high tide height and low tide height. As the notch becomes deeper (and sub-aerial weathering weakens the cliff from the top) the cliff face becomes unstable and falls under its own weight through mass movement. This leaves behind a platform of the unaffected cliff base beneath the wave-cut notch.</li> <br><img src="includes/wcp.png"><br>
        <li>▪ Retreating Cliffs - Through the process of repeat wave-cut notches and platforms, new cliff faces are created, whilst the land retreats.</li><br>
<li>▪ Blowhole - A Blowhole is a combination of two features: a pot hole on top of a cliff, created by chemical weathering, and a cave, formed by marine erosion. As the cave erodes deeper into the cliff face and the pothole deepens, they may meet. In this case, a channel is created for incoming waves to travel into and up the cliff face (occasionally water splashes out of the top of the blowhole when energetic waves hit the cliff face).
