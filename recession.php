	<h2>Rates of coastal recession</h2>
	<ul>
<li>The resistance of a rock will determine its vulnerability to erosion, and is influenced by various factors:</li> <br>
<li>▪ Whether rocks are clastic or crystalline – sedimentary rocks like sandstone are clastic as they are made up of cemented sediment particles, therefore are vulnerable to erosion, whereas
    igneous and metamorphic rocks are made up of interlocking crystals, making them more resistant to erosion.</li><br>
<li>▪ The amount of cracks, fractures and fissures – the more weaknesses there are in the rock the more open it is to erosional processes, especially Hydraulic Action.</li><br>
<li>▪ The lithology of the rock - as shown in the table below, the type of rocks and the conditions of the rock’s creation directly affects its vulnerability to erosion</li><br>
