	<h2>Sub-Aerial Processes - Weathering and Mass Movement</h2>
	<ul>

    <li>Sub-Aerial Processes - Weathering and Mass Movement Weathering is the breakdown of rocks (mechanical, biological or chemical) over time, leading to the transfer of material into the littoral zone, where it becomes an input to sediment cells.</li><br>
<li>Mechanical (Physical) Weathering: the breakdown of rocks due to exertion of physical forces without any chemical changes taking place: </li><br>
<li>● Freeze-thaw (Frost-Shattering): Water enters cracks in rocks and then the water freezes overnight during the winter. As it freezes, water expands by around 10% in volume which increases the pressure acting on a rock, causing cracks to develop. Over time these cracks grow, weakening the cliff making is more vulnerable to other processes of erosion</li><br>
<li>● Salt Crystallisation: As seawater evaporates, salt is left behind. Salt crystals will grow over time, exerting pressure on the rock, which forces the cracks to widen. Salt can also corrode ferrous (materials that contains iron) rock due to chemical reactions</li><br>
<li>● Wetting and Drying: Rocks such as clay expand when wet and then contract again when they are drying. The frequent cycles of wetting and drying at the coast can cause these rocks and cliffs to break up</li><br>
<li>Chemical weathering - the breakdown of rocks through chemical reactions. There are different types of chemical weathering: </li><br>
<li>● Carbonation: Rainwater absorbs CO2 from the air to create a weak carbonic acid which then reacts with calcium carbonate in rocks to form calcium bicarbonate which can then be easily dissolved. Acid rain reacts with limestone to form calcium bicarbonate, which is then easily dissolved allowing erosion. </li><br>
<li>● Oxidation: When minerals become exposed to the air through cracks and fissures , the mineral will become oxidised which will increase its volume (contributing to mechanical weathering), causing the rock to crumble. The most common oxidation within rocks is iron minerals becoming iron oxide, turning the rock rusty orange after being exposed to the air. </li><br>
<li>● Solution: When rock minerals such as rock salt are dissolved. </li><br>
<li>Biological Weathering - the breakdown of rocks due to the actions of plants, bacteria and animals: </li><br>
<li>● Plant Roots - Roots of plants growing into the cracks of rocks, which exerts pressure, eventually splitting the rocks. Research Angkor Wat for more information on this, even though it is not coastal! </li><br>
<li>● Birds - Some birds such as Puffins dig burrows into cliffs weakening them and making erosion more likely. </li><br>
<li>● Rock Boring - Many species of clams secrete chemicals that dissolve rocks and piddocks may burrow into the rock face</li><br>
<li>● Seaweed Acids - Some seaweeds contain pockets of sulphuric acid, which if hit against a rock or cliff face, the acid will dissolve some of the rock’s minerals. (e.g. Kelp) </li><br>
<li>● Decaying Vegetation - Water that flows through decaying vegetation and then over coastal areas, will be acidic, thus causing chemical weathering </li><br>

<li>Mass Movement: </li><br>
<li>There are several types of mass movement, which tend to be determined by the weight of the sediment and its ability to flow downhill. </li><br>
<li>The type of mass movement that occurs depends on: </li><br>
<li>- the angle of the slope/cliff</li><br>
<li>- the rock’s lithology and geology</li><br>
<li>- the vegetation cover on the cliff face</li><br>
<li>- the saturation of the ground/ previous weather patterns</li><br>
<li>There are two different categories of mass movement: a slide and a flow. For a slide, sediment keeps its same place within the whole material, simply moves downhill. However, for a flow, all the material flows downs and mixes. </li><br>
<li>Flows include: </li><br>
<li>● Soil creep - The slowest but continuous form of mass movement involving the movement of soil particles downhill. </li><br>
<li>● Solifluction - Occurs mainly in tundra areas where the land is frozen. As the top layers thaws during summer (but the lower layers still stay frozen due to permafrost) the surface layers flows over the frozen layers. </li><br>
<li>● Mudflows - An increase in the water content of soil can reduce friction, leading to earth and mud to flow over underlying bedrock. </li><br>
<li>Slides include: </li><br>
<li>● Rock falls - Occur on sloped cliffs (over 40o ) when exposed to mechanical weathering. </li><br>
<li>● Rock slides - Water between joints and bedding planes (which are parallel to the cliff face) can reduce friction and lead to more sliding. </li><br>
<li>● Slumps - Occur when the soil is saturated with water, causing a rotation movement of soft materials (such as clay and sand) forming rotational scars and terraced cliff profiles. </li><br>

<li>Vulnerability to Sub-Aerial Processes - Temperature and climate can influence the prominent process of weathering. In colder climates, mechanical weathering is more common whereas in warmer climates, chemical weathering is more common. </li><br>
<li>Landforms of Mass Movement - Cliff profiles</li><br>
<li>Cliff profiles are influenced by many factors but the two main characteristics that dominate are: </li><br>
<li>- The resistance of the rock to erosion</li><br>
<li>- The dip in rock strata in relation to the sea</li><br>
<li>Many cliffed coastlines are composite (they have different rock layers) which makes explaining cliff profiles very complex. </li><br>
